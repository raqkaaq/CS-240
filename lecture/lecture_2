Will need to write javadoc for the family map server and client.

Primative data types:
	byte	
	short	
	int	
	long	
	float	
	double	
	char	
	boolean	-true boolean
	There is a wrapper class for each of the data types:
		Byte
		Short
		Double
		Long
		Float
		Double
		Boolean
	Converting string into int
		int Integer.parseInt(String value); etc.
	There are no unsigned datatypes in java	
	In java you dont have to worry about destinguishing pointers, because everything is a pointer unless it is a primative data type
	In java strings are immutable, you cannot change them. Everytime that it would change a string it creates another string.
	All java classes inherit from class Object
